# Bugs 

- [ ] Autofocus on file submission in question-detail

- [ ] In most forms, when the user (1) click in delete, (2) cancel the delete, and (3) 
click the "back" hyperlink in the form page, it returns to the delete page. This is 
a bit challenging to make right because the user can arrive in the form page from 
different pages.
